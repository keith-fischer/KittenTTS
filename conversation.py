Bella|1.4|You all made it, which means tonight is already a success.
Jasper|1.3|I made it five minutes early. I’m emotionally available and chronically punctual.
Kiki|1.7|Chronic punctuality is not a personality, Jasper.
Jasper|1.4|It is if you commit hard enough.
Luna|1.5|I’m committing to this couch. It’s the most supportive relationship I’ve had all week.
Leo|1.6|Don’t say that in front of Bruno. He’ll take it personally.
Bruno|1.3|I don’t get jealous. I just… evaluate threats.
Rosie|1.4|The couch is a serious threat. It has arms and everything.
Bella|1.5|Okay, rule of the night: one compliment per person before any teasing.
Kiki|1.8|Fine. Leo, your hair looks like you planned it, which is rare for men.
Leo|1.6|That’s both a compliment and a drive-by. Respect.
Jasper|1.4|Bella, you look like trouble in the best possible way.
Bella|1.5|That one counts. Keep going, golden retriever.
Luna|1.4|Rosie, your eyeliner is so sharp it could cut through my indecision.
Rosie|1.3|Thank you. I sharpened it with spite and precision.
Bruno|1.2|Kiki, your energy is… terrifyingly magnetic.
Kiki|1.7|That’s the nicest thing anyone’s ever said to me in a haunted way.
Leo|1.5|Bruno, your shirt is aggressively well-fitted. Who are you trying to impress?
Bruno|1.3|Nobody. I just prefer my fabric to respect me.
Rosie|1.4|That sentence is why you’re single.
Bruno|1.2|I’m not single. I’m… under review.
Luna|1.5|Under review by who?
Bruno|1.3|By fate. And maybe Rosie.
Rosie|1.7|Don’t drag me into your corporate romance.
Bella|1.5|Corporate romance is disgusting. Continue immediately.
Jasper|1.4|I’m just saying, if Bella ran HR, I’d submit complaints just to get meetings.
Bella|1.5|That’s flirting and paperwork. I’m conflicted.
Kiki|1.8|Bella loves paperwork. Jasper just hacked her heart.
Leo|1.6|Speaking of hacking hearts, Luna… you’ve been quiet. Suspiciously quiet.
Luna|1.3|I’m observing. Flirting is like wildlife. If you move too fast, you scare it away.
Leo|1.6|Noted. I will become a gentle forest creature.
Rosie|1.4|You’d be a peacock, Leo. Don’t lie.
Leo|1.7|Peacocks are magnificent. I accept.
Bruno|1.3|Peacocks are loud, dramatic, and hard to ignore.
Leo|1.5|So you *have* been paying attention.
Bruno|1.2|Unfortunately, yes.
Bella|1.4|Alright, we need a game. Something that forces feelings to happen.
Kiki|1.8|Truth or dare, but only truth because dares lead to property damage.
Jasper|1.4|I support truth. Dare is how I ended up with a scar shaped like regret.
Luna|1.4|Truth it is. Who goes first?
Rosie|1.4|Leo. He’s the most likely to lie confidently.
Leo|1.6|Rude but fair. Ask me anything.
Bella|1.5|Who here would you kiss if the lights went out for ten seconds?
Leo|1.7|In ten seconds? That’s a speedrun of romance.
Kiki|1.8|Answer, peacock.
Leo|1.5|Rosie.
Rosie|1.2|That was… direct.
Leo|1.4|Direct is the only way I know how to be.
Bruno|1.3|He’s bluffing.
Leo|1.6|I’m absolutely not bluffing.
Rosie|1.4|Bruno, why do you care?
Bruno|1.2|I don’t. I’m just… evaluating threats.
Kiki|1.9|Threat confirmed.
Bella|1.5|Okay, my turn: Jasper. Same question.
Jasper|1.4|Bella. Easily.
Bella|1.3|Easily? Sir, you are bold tonight.
Jasper|1.5|I’m bold because you keep smiling at me like you already know the answer.
Luna|1.5|Ew. Cute. Continue.
Kiki|1.8|I need a bucket for my feelings. This is disgusting in a fun way.
Rosie|1.4|Luna, your turn. Who would you kiss?
Luna|1.3|I’m not answering unless I get immunity from teasing.
Leo|1.6|Impossible. Teasing is our love language.
Luna|1.4|Fine. Kiki.
Kiki|1.3|Wait—me?
Luna|1.5|Yes. You’re loud and brave and you make me feel less scared of being seen.
Kiki|1.2|That was… unfairly sweet. I’m slowing down to process.
Bella|1.4|Kiki at 1.2 speed is a rare cosmic event.
Bruno|1.3|I feel like I just witnessed a solar eclipse.
Kiki|1.4|Bruno, shut up before I cry and ruin my brand.
Rosie|1.3|Kiki, your turn. Who would you kiss?
Kiki|1.6|Luna. Obviously. I’m not letting her be vulnerable alone.
Luna|1.3|Okay. Now I’m the one processing.
Leo|1.5|This is adorable and I hate how much I enjoy it.
Bella|1.5|Bruno, your turn. No dodging. Who would you kiss?
Bruno|1.2|Rosie.
Rosie|1.4|You didn’t even hesitate.
Bruno|1.3|Hesitation is for people who don’t know what they want.
Leo|1.6|Excuse me while I pretend I’m not affected by that.
Rosie|1.3|Why me, Bruno?
Bruno|1.2|Because you’re sharp, and you see everything, and somehow you don’t use it to hurt people.
Rosie|1.2|That’s… a dangerous compliment.
Bella|1.5|Okay, now we have couples forming like a chaotic chemistry experiment.
Jasper|1.4|Bella and I are not a couple.
Bella|1.5|Correct. We’re a slow-burning disaster.
Kiki|1.7|That’s romance. Don’t fight it.
Luna|1.4|Rosie and Bruno are giving “enemies to lovers” in a library.
Rosie|1.4|We are not enemies.
Bruno|1.3|We’re colleagues in emotional warfare.
Leo|1.6|And where does that leave me? Alone with my peacock feathers?
Bella|1.5|Leo, you chose Rosie. But Rosie has… options.
Rosie|1.3|I didn’t say I had options.
Kiki|1.8|You literally do. Two men just offered their mouths into the void.
Luna|1.5|Kiki, please stop describing it like that.
Jasper|1.4|Bella, can I ask you something real?
Bella|1.3|Go ahead.
Jasper|1.2|When I flirt with you, do you feel flattered… or hunted?
Bella|1.4|Flattered. And a little hunted. But in a “I might like it” way.
Jasper|1.5|Good. Because I don’t want to scare you. I just want your attention.
Bella|1.4|You have it. Now what?
Jasper|1.4|Now I ask if I can hold your hand without making it weird.
Bella|1.3|It’ll be weird, but we can do it anyway.
Kiki|1.8|Hand-holding alert! I’m going to combust.
Luna|1.5|Let them have this, chaos goblin.
Leo|1.6|Rosie, can I be honest too?
Rosie|1.3|Depends. Are you about to do something dramatic?
Leo|1.5|Yes. Emotionally. Not physically.
Bruno|1.3|That’s still dramatic.
Leo|1.4|I flirt like it’s a sport, but with you I get nervous.
Rosie|1.2|You? Nervous?
Leo|1.5|Yeah. Because you don’t fall for shiny words. You want something true.
Rosie|1.3|And do you have something true?
Leo|1.4|I like you. I like the way you pretend you’re unbothered when you’re actually soft.
Rosie|1.1|That’s… annoyingly accurate.
Bruno|1.2|He’s good.
Kiki|1.8|Bruno is jealous. Mark the calendar.
Bruno|1.3|I’m not jealous.
Bella|1.5|You’re evaluating threats.
Bruno|1.2|Correct.
Luna|1.4|Kiki… are you okay? You got quiet again.
Kiki|1.3|I’m okay. I just… I don’t know how to be gentle without feeling exposed.
Luna|1.2|You don’t have to be gentle all the time. Just honest with me.
Kiki|1.3|Honest is scary.
Luna|1.2|I know. I’m still here.
Kiki|1.2|Okay. Then I’m still here too.
Leo|1.5|This room is dangerously romantic right now.
Rosie|1.4|It’s like a romance novel, but with snacks and emotional damage.
Jasper|1.4|Bella, your hand is warm.
Bella|1.3|So is your face. You’re blushing.
Jasper|1.5|I’m not blushing. I’m… overheating with dignity.
Bella|1.5|Overheating with dignity is my favorite new phrase.
Bruno|1.2|Rosie, can I say one more thing?
Rosie|1.3|Make it count.
Bruno|1.2|When you look at me, I want to become someone worth looking at.
Rosie|1.1|That’s… unfair.
Leo|1.6|Bruno just landed a critical hit.
Kiki|1.7|Rosie is going to short-circuit.
Rosie|1.2|I’m not short-circuiting. I’m… recalibrating.
Luna|1.5|Look at us. Flirting turned into feelings. Classic trap.
Bella|1.5|Okay, final question for the night: what do you want from the person you chose?
Jasper|1.3|I want Bella to keep laughing at my dumb jokes for a long time.
Bella|1.3|I want Jasper to keep being brave, even when he’s scared.
Kiki|1.2|I want Luna to let me be a mess without running away.
Luna|1.2|I want Kiki to trust that I’m not fragile. I can handle her truth.
Leo|1.4|I want Rosie to give me a chance to be serious.
Rosie|1.2|I want Leo to prove his words have bones.
Bruno|1.2|I want Rosie to stop acting like she has to carry everything alone.
Rosie|1.2|And I want Bruno to stop pretending he doesn’t need anyone.
Bella|1.5|Well. That’s… actually beautiful.
Jasper|1.4|So… do we seal this with a kiss or do we all panic and go home?
Kiki|1.9|Panic is boring. Kiss is better.
Luna|1.3|Agreed. But slow. No speedrunning romance.
Leo|1.6|I can do slow. For Rosie, I can do slow.
Rosie|1.2|Prove it.
Bruno|1.1|And for me?
Rosie|1.2|You already did.
Bella|1.4|Alright then. No more games. Just… stay close.
Jasper|1.3|Gladly.

conversation2="""
Bella|1.5|Alright, globe-trot goblins, group vacation planning starts now.
Jasper|1.4|I made a spreadsheet. Please don’t throw peanuts at me.
Kiki|1.7|Spreadsheet boy is already flirting with organization.
Luna|1.5|I’m flirting with sleep, but I’m here and I’m committed.
Bruno|1.3|We need rules: budget, dates, and no one “accidentally” books a camel trek at 3 AM.
Leo|1.6|Counterpoint: the camel trek is the whole point.
Rosie|1.4|First decision: how many countries before we collapse into a single shared hoodie?
Bella|1.5|I want a “greatest hits” loop: Europe, Africa, Asia, Oceania, South America.
Jasper|1.2|That’s… five continents. My wallet just sat down.
Kiki|1.8|Your wallet needs cardio. We’re doing it.
Luna|1.5|Can we start somewhere cozy? Like Japan in spring? Cherry blossoms, ramen, vibes.
Bruno|1.4|Japan is good. Efficient transit. Predictable chaos.
Leo|1.6|Tokyo nights, neon everything, and at least one karaoke incident.
Rosie|1.5|Tokyo yes, but also Kyoto for temples and quiet.
Bella|1.4|So: Japan leg is Tokyo + Kyoto. Great. Next continent before Jasper faints.
Jasper|1.3|I’m not fainting. I’m… gently rebooting.
Kiki|1.9|If you faint, I’m writing “dramatic” on your passport photo.
Luna|1.4|Europe next. Italy? I want pasta that changes my personality.
Bruno|1.4|Italy is a logistical honey trap. But worth it.
Leo|1.7|Rome, Florence, Venice—classic romance circuit.
Rosie|1.3|Venice is pretty, but also a damp maze. We should research seasons.
Bella|1.5|We go shoulder season. Less crowds, less “human soup” energy.
Jasper|1.4|Finally, a sentence that makes me feel safe.
Kiki|1.8|Nobody is safe. Continue.
Luna|1.5|We also need one weird Europe pick. Like Iceland.
Bruno|1.4|Hot springs, volcanoes, and existential weather. Approved.
Leo|1.6|Iceland gives us dramatic photos and dramatic feelings.
Rosie|1.2|And dramatic prices. We’ll need to plan that carefully.
Bella|1.5|Okay: Japan, Italy, Iceland. That’s already elite. Next: Africa.
Jasper|1.3|Please say “Morocco” and not “summit Kilimanjaro.”
Kiki|1.6|Morocco. Markets, mint tea, colors that punch your soul.
Luna|1.5|Yes! Marrakech, then a desert night under stars.
Bruno|1.4|Desert night means temperature drop. Pack layers or perish.
Leo|1.6|I volunteer to carry extra layers for anyone who compliments me.
Rosie|1.4|That’s not volunteering, that’s bargaining.
Leo|1.5|Correct.
Bella|1.5|South America: Peru for Machu Picchu?
Jasper|1.2|My knees would like a formal apology.
Kiki|1.7|We can take the train route. Don’t be dramatic.
Bruno|1.4|Peru is solid. Altitude acclimation days. No heroic sprints.
Luna|1.5|And we eat everything. I want ceviche and joy.
Rosie|1.3|We should plan food safety too. Not glamorous, but necessary.
Leo|1.5|Rosie is the trip mom and I respect it.
Rosie|1.2|Trip mom hates that nickname.
Kiki|1.9|Trip mom is canon now. Sorry.
Bella|1.5|Oceania: New Zealand. Lord of the Rings scenery. Nature reset.
Jasper|1.4|Thank you. A country where “go outside” is the activity.
Bruno|1.4|New Zealand logistics are easy. Long flights, but manageable.
Luna|1.4|I want one day where we do nothing but stare at mountains.
Leo|1.5|I will stare at mountains and also at whoever is next to me.
Rosie|1.3|Leo, please flirt responsibly.
Leo|1.6|I never do anything responsibly.
Bella|1.5|We still need North America or are we counting “home” as the start?
Jasper|1.3|Home counts as “where we pack poorly and panic.”
Kiki|1.7|True. Also we need a beach stop. Thailand? Or Bali?
Luna|1.5|Bali has the “healing journey” aesthetic.
Bruno|1.3|Thailand has incredible food and islands. Also chaotic scooters.
Rosie|1.4|I’d rather not die on a scooter for the vibes.
Leo|1.5|We can do islands without scooters. Boat life.
Bella|1.5|Okay: Thailand islands. Beach leg added. Now we need timeline.
Jasper|1.2|Timeline is where dreams go to be audited.
Kiki|1.8|Audit my dreams, Jasper. I dare you.
Luna|1.4|How long total? Two months? Three?
Bruno|1.4|Realistically: four to six weeks if we want to survive employment.
Rosie|1.5|Six weeks is ambitious but plausible if we plan transitions smartly.
Leo|1.6|I’m voting six weeks because I like who I become on week four.
Bella|1.5|Six weeks it is. Now order: start in Japan, then Southeast Asia, then Europe, then Africa, then South America, then New Zealand.
Jasper|1.4|That routing actually reduces backtracking. I’m proud.
Kiki|1.9|He’s proud! Somebody get a photo—rare emotion detected.
Luna|1.3|I’m proud too, but quietly, because I’m still half asleep.
Bruno|1.4|Budget framework: flights, lodging, food, activities, emergency buffer.
Rosie|1.4|And travel insurance. Non-negotiable.
Leo|1.5|Travel insurance is adulting. Fine. I’ll be an adult for paperwork only.
Bella|1.5|Lodging style: mix of hotels, hostels, and one fancy splurge stay.
Jasper|1.3|Define “fancy” before Kiki books a castle with a moat.
Kiki|1.8|A moat is practical. Keeps the haters out.
Luna|1.5|One fancy night in Italy. Like a villa situation.
Bruno|1.4|A villa for seven people is actually cost-effective if split right.
Rosie|1.3|As long as we confirm it’s not “villa” meaning “converted shed.”
Leo|1.6|I’m okay with a shed if it has romance lighting.
Bella|1.5|Activities: one big adventure per region, one chill day after.
Jasper|1.4|Yes. Scheduled recovery days. My soul thanks you.
Kiki|1.7|I will pretend to agree and then emotionally sprint anyway.
Luna|1.5|Adventure picks: Japan—hike near Fuji. Thailand—snorkeling. Italy—cooking class.
Bruno|1.4|Iceland—hot springs and a glacier walk. Morocco—desert camp. Peru—Machu Picchu.
Rosie|1.4|New Zealand—day hike and stargazing. Also: museum days for balance.
Leo|1.5|And one night per country where we dress up and go somewhere fancy.
Bella|1.6|Leo wants a “fashion montage” across continents.
Jasper|1.3|I support this. I want at least one photo where we look like an album cover.
Kiki|1.9|We will be the most confusing band in history.
Luna|1.4|Band name: “Delayed Boarding.”
Bruno|1.4|Or “Carry-On Chaos.”
Rosie|1.3|Or “Trip Mom and the Problems.”
Leo|1.7|Trip Mom and the Problems is iconic.
Rosie|1.8|Stop calling me Trip Mom or I will start charging fees.
Bella|1.5|Okay, roles: Jasper handles spreadsheets and routing.
Jasper|1.5|I accept. I was born for this.
Kiki|1.6|Kiki handles vibes and spontaneous surprises.
Bruno|1.4|That sentence gives me hives.
Luna|1.4|Luna handles food planning and “must-try” lists.
Rosie|1.4|Rosie handles safety, bookings verification, and reality checks.
Leo|1.6|Leo handles… morale, outfits, and flirting with the concept of travel.
Bella|1.5|Bella handles the master checklist and herding cats.
Bruno|1.3|Bruno handles budget tracking so we don’t sell organs in Iceland.
Kiki|1.9|My organs are not for sale. They’re for adventure.
Jasper|1.4|Deposit plan: everyone contributes monthly into a shared travel fund.
Rosie|1.4|And we track spending with receipts. No “mystery cash vanish.”
Leo|1.3|I feel personally attacked by “mystery cash vanish.”
Luna|1.5|Vaccines and visas: who’s checking requirements?
Rosie|1.4|I’ll make a checklist by country. Deadlines included.
Bella|1.5|Packing philosophy: one carry-on if possible, one checked bag max.
Kiki|1.7|I refuse minimalist tyranny. I have outfits with emotional arcs.
Bruno|1.4|Emotional arcs are not exempt from baggage limits.
Jasper|1.4|We can do capsule wardrobes. Mix and match. Science and style.
Leo|1.6|I love when Jasper says “science” about clothes.
Luna|1.4|Can we plan one “no phones” afternoon somewhere beautiful?
Rosie|1.3|Yes. We pick a safe scenic spot and actually be humans.
Bella|1.5|Done. Also one “write postcards” night because we’re charmingly old-fashioned.
Kiki|1.6|I will write postcards full of lies and poetry.
Bruno|1.3|Please label them as fiction.
Jasper|1.4|Okay, real talk: what’s everyone’s biggest fear on this trip?
Luna|1.3|Missing flights. I get stress dreams about airports.
Leo|1.5|My fear is boredom. Which is why I keep proposing chaos.
Rosie|1.2|My fear is unsafe situations we didn’t anticipate.
Bruno|1.3|My fear is blowing the budget and pretending it’s “fine.”
Kiki|1.6|My fear is… honestly? Getting sick and missing the fun.
Bella|1.4|My fear is group tension. So we communicate like adults, even when we’re gremlins.
Jasper|1.5|Agreed. Weekly check-ins. Feelings and logistics.
Kiki|1.6|Feelings and logistics sounds like a podcast hosted by Bruno.
Bruno|1.4|I would never. Unless it had charts.
Leo|1.6|It would absolutely have charts.
Rosie|1.3|Alright. Next steps: dates, deposits, passports, and the booking timeline.
Bella|1.5|And one more thing: at least once, we all watch a sunrise together.
Luna|1.2|A sunrise? That’s cruel… but also beautiful.
Jasper|1.4|I’ll bring coffee. I’m not a monster.
Kiki|1.7|I’ll bring chaos. I am a monster, but a lovable one.
Bruno|1.4|I’ll bring snacks. Snacks prevent mutiny.
Leo|1.5|I’ll bring a playlist that makes the world feel cinematic.
Rosie|1.3|I’ll bring band-aids and common sense.
Bella|1.5|Perfect. Around the world, with snacks, spreadsheets, and questionable flirting—let’s go.
