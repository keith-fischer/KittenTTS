Bruno|1.2|They say the city sleeps at night.
Bruno|1.2|They’re wrong. It just changes masks.
Bruno|1.2|Neon bruises the rain, sirens sing in the distance, and trouble walks on polished shoes.
Bruno|1.2|Tonight, trouble had a name: the Black Meridian.
Bruno|1.2|Not a person. Not a gang. A deal.
Bruno|1.2|A shipment moving through the docks at 2:17 a.m., carrying something nobody was supposed to own.
Bruno|1.2|And somehow—through bad luck, good timing, and Kiki’s inability to ignore shiny mysteries—
Bruno|1.2|we were in it.

Bella|1.5|Everybody check your gear. And don’t give me that look, Jasper—yes, the flashlight matters.
Jasper|1.3|I’m not giving you a look. I’m giving the flashlight respect.
Kiki|1.8|I brought bolt cutters and vibes. The two essential travel items.
Luna|1.4|I brought water and snacks. Because you all forget you’re mortal.
Leo|1.6|I brought confidence. It’s weightless and extremely portable.
Rosie|1.4|I brought a first-aid kit and common sense. I expect to lose both.
Bruno|1.2|We moved like a badly organized heist movie—except the stakes were real.
Bruno|1.2|The docks stretched ahead: cranes like giant skeletons, containers stacked like a maze made of metal.
Bruno|1.2|Rain whispered on corrugated steel.
Bruno|1.2|And somewhere inside that maze was the Meridian crate.

Bella|1.5|Remember: quiet feet, quiet mouths, loud confidence.
Kiki|1.9|My confidence is loud by nature.
Rosie|1.3|Then muzzle it.
Leo|1.6|Rosie, that was terrifying. I’m strangely attracted to your competence.
Rosie|1.4|Focus.
Jasper|1.3|I’m focusing so hard my brain is sweating.
Luna|1.4|If your brain sweats, you should see a doctor.

Bruno|1.2|We slipped between containers.
Bruno|1.2|Somewhere, a forklift beeped like a warning from the universe.
Bruno|1.2|Ahead, two guards lounged under a floodlight, talking and laughing like the night belonged to them.
Bruno|1.2|It did—until Kiki decided it didn’t.

Kiki|1.7|I can distract them.
Bella|1.4|No. Absolutely not.
Kiki|1.8|Yes. Absolutely yes.
Rosie|1.4|Define “distract.”
Kiki|1.7|I walk up like I own the place, ask for directions, and if that fails—
Kiki|1.9|—I bonk them with my feelings.
Jasper|1.4|That’s not a plan. That’s a poem with violence in it.
Leo|1.6|Let her cook. Chaos is a spice.
Luna|1.4|Chaos is also how people get arrested.

Bruno|1.2|Bella took command with the kind of calm that makes you trust her even when you shouldn’t.
Bruno|1.2|She pointed at Leo and Jasper.

Bella|1.5|Leo, go flirt. Jasper, back him up. Kiki, do not improvise a felony.
Kiki|1.6|I make no promises.
Jasper|1.2|My entire body is a promise of anxiety.

Leo|1.6|Evening, gentlemen.
Leo|1.5|Quick question—where do you keep the office with the forms nobody wants to fill out?
Guard1|1.6|What?
Leo|1.6|Forms. Paperwork. The soul-crushing stuff. I’m lost and spiritually exhausted.
Guard2|1.6|You’re not supposed to be here.
Leo|1.7|That’s what my therapist says about my emotions too.
Jasper|1.3|He’s with me.
Jasper|1.4|We’re… contractors. Night contractors. For… steel. Very steel-related.
Guard1|1.8|You’re lying.
Leo|1.4|I’m never lying when I say you have great posture.
Guard2|1.9|What is happening?

Bruno|1.2|While the guards tried to parse Leo’s weaponized charm,
Bruno|1.2|Bella motioned us around the floodlight’s edge.
Bruno|1.2|Rosie and Luna moved like shadows.
Bruno|1.2|Kiki moved like a storm pretending to be a shadow.

Rosie|1.3|Stay low. Stay quiet.
Luna|1.4|Stay alive. Big fan of staying alive.
Kiki|1.7|Alive is the minimum. I’m aiming for legendary.
Bella|1.5|Legendary later. Now: crate map.

Bruno|1.2|I unfolded the smudged printout.
Bruno|1.2|A grid of container IDs, one circled in red: M-13.
Bruno|1.2|The Meridian.
Bruno|1.2|Of course it was in the deepest part of the maze.

Bruno|1.2|We slid past a row of containers marked with shipping codes and rust.
Bruno|1.2|The air smelled like salt, diesel, and secrets.
Bruno|1.2|Then—footsteps.
Bruno|1.2|Fast. Multiple.

Bella|1.2|Freeze.
Kiki|1.3|I hate freezing.
Rosie|1.2|Do it anyway.
Luna|1.2|Please freeze. I’m not emotionally prepared for running yet.

Bruno|1.2|We pressed into the shadows.
Bruno|1.2|A patrol swept by, flashlights cutting through the rain like knives.
Bruno|1.2|One beam paused—too close.

Kiki|1.1|Don’t look over here. Don’t look over here.
Kiki|1.0|I swear I’m just a wet container.

Bruno|1.2|The beam moved on.
Bruno|1.2|Kiki exhaled like she’d been holding her breath since childhood.

Bella|1.5|Okay. Move. Now.

Bruno|1.2|We found M-13 wedged between towering stacks.
Bruno|1.2|A single container, newer than the rest, painted matte black like it absorbed light.
Bruno|1.2|On its door: a symbol—an arrow splitting a circle.
Bruno|1.2|The Black Meridian.

Rosie|1.4|That’s not subtle.
Luna|1.4|Villains never do subtle.
Kiki|1.8|I want it on a jacket.

Bella|1.5|Bruno, open it.
Bruno|1.2|I would love to, except it’s locked with a keypad and a tamper seal.
Jasper|1.3|I can pick it.
Bella|1.4|Since when can you pick locks?
Jasper|1.4|Since I learned fear is a teacher.
Kiki|1.8|That’s hot.
Jasper|1.2|Please don’t make it weird.
Kiki|1.7|I make everything weird. It’s my gift.

Bruno|1.2|Jasper knelt by the lock, hands steady despite the panic in his eyes.
Bruno|1.2|He pulled a thin tool kit from his pocket like he’d been waiting his whole life for this moment.
Bruno|1.2|Which, to be fair, he probably had.

Jasper|1.0|Okay. Quiet. Give me quiet.
Bella|1.3|You have quiet.
Jasper|1.1|I need… more quiet.
Luna|1.2|We are literally whispering in a rainstorm at midnight.
Jasper|1.0|Yes. More quiet.

Bruno|1.2|Click.
Bruno|1.2|Click.
Bruno|1.2|The keypad blinked.
Bruno|1.2|Then flashed green.

Jasper|1.6|Yes!
Jasper|1.2|Sorry. Yes.

Bella|1.5|Good. Open it.
Rosie|1.3|Slowly. There might be an alarm.
Kiki|1.7|Or a snake. Villains love snakes.

Bruno|1.2|The doors groaned open.
Bruno|1.2|Inside: a smaller crate, foam-sealed, marked with hazard stripes and a single word:
Bruno|1.2|AURORA.

Luna|1.3|That sounds like a spaceship or a perfume.
Rosie|1.3|Or a weapon.
Leo|1.6|Or both. Imagine the marketing.
Bella|1.4|We’re not here for marketing. We’re here to stop whatever this is.

Bruno|1.2|Behind us—metal clanged.
Bruno|1.2|A boot scraped concrete.
Bruno|1.2|And a voice rolled through the dark like gravel.

Unknown|1.7|Step away from the container.

Kiki|1.8|I hate when strangers give commands.
Rosie|1.4|Everyone stay calm.
Bella|1.5|Hands where they can see them. No sudden moves.

Bruno|1.2|Floodlights snapped on.
Bruno|1.2|We were caught in white glare.
Bruno|1.2|Three figures approached, faces hidden under hoods.
Bruno|1.2|And in the middle—someone taller, coat long, posture confident.
Bruno|1.2|Their hand rested on something that was definitely not friendly.

Leader|1.6|You’re nosy.
Leader|1.6|Nosy people don’t live long.

Leo|1.7|Counterpoint: nosy people invent science.
Rosie|1.4|Leo!
Leo|1.5|What? I’m negotiating with facts.

Bella|1.5|We don’t want trouble. We’re leaving.
Leader|1.6|Not empty-handed, you’re not.
Jasper|1.3|We didn’t take anything.
Leader|1.6|Yet.

Bruno|1.2|Kiki’s fingers twitched near her bolt cutters.
Bruno|1.2|Rosie’s stance shifted—ready, balanced.
Bruno|1.2|Luna swallowed hard but didn’t step back.
Bruno|1.2|Bella looked the leader dead in the face like she’d seen worse.
Bruno|1.2|And me?
Bruno|1.2|I did what any sensible narrator would do:
Bruno|1.2|I panicked internally and spoke calmly externally.

Bruno|1.2|Let’s not do anything irreversible.
Leader|1.6|Irreversible is kind of our brand.

Kiki|2.0|Okay! I’m done being polite!
Bella|1.8|Kiki—NO!
Kiki|2.0|Too late!

Bruno|1.2|Kiki kicked a loose pallet.
Bruno|1.2|It slid across wet concrete like a hockey puck—
Bruno|1.2|and slammed into one of the hooded figures’ knees.
Bruno|1.2|They went down with a yelp.

Rosie|1.8|Move!
Luna|1.7|Run!
Jasper|1.6|Why is it always running?!
Leo|1.8|Because walking is for people who aren’t being shot at!

Bruno|1.2|We bolted.
Bruno|1.2|Footsteps thundered behind us.
Bruno|1.2|A flashlight beam whipped past my shoulder.
Bruno|1.2|Something cracked against a container wall—bullet? stone? my sanity? Hard to say.

Bella|1.6|This way! Left!
Kiki|1.9|I’m going left with enthusiasm!
Rosie|1.7|Stay together!
Luna|1.6|I am together! I’m just together while terrified!

Bruno|1.2|We ducked into a narrow corridor of containers.
Bruno|1.2|It dead-ended.
Bruno|1.2|Of course it did.

Jasper|1.9|Dead end!
Kiki|1.9|I noticed!
Leo|1.8|Okay, new plan: up!
Luna|1.7|Up?!
Rosie|1.6|Climb! Now!

Bruno|1.2|Rosie grabbed a ladder welded to a container’s side.
Bruno|1.2|Bella went first, hauling herself up like gravity owed her money.
Bruno|1.2|Leo followed, then Luna, then me.
Bruno|1.2|Kiki went last—of course she did—throwing a grin over her shoulder at the oncoming footsteps.

Kiki|2.0|Catch me if you can, weird coat guy!

Bruno|1.2|We hit the top of the container stack.
Bruno|1.2|The wind slapped us.
Bruno|1.2|Rain stung like needles.
Bruno|1.2|Below, the leader stepped into view, looking up with slow, measured anger.

Leader|1.4|You can’t outrun the Meridian.
Bella|1.6|Watch us.

Bruno|1.2|We sprinted across metal roofs.
Bruno|1.2|The containers flexed under our weight, echoing like drums.
Bruno|1.2|Far ahead: a crane platform with a service catwalk—an escape route if we could reach it.

Rosie|1.6|Don’t look down!
Luna|1.3|I wasn’t!
Luna|1.7|Now I am!
Jasper|1.6|I hate heights!
Leo|1.7|Then love them faster!

Bruno|1.2|A shot rang out.
Bruno|1.2|Metal sparked near Leo’s foot.

Leo|2.0|Okay! That was personal!
Kiki|1.9|Now I’m mad!
Bella|1.8|No hero moves! Keep running!

Bruno|1.2|We leapt a gap between stacks—one container to another.
Bruno|1.2|Luna nearly slipped, but Kiki caught her wrist.

Kiki|1.2|I’ve got you.
Luna|1.1|Thank you.
Kiki|1.3|Don’t thank me yet. Jump.

Luna|1.8|Jumping now!

Bruno|1.2|We reached the crane platform.
Bruno|1.2|A catwalk stretched out toward the warehouse roof.
Bruno|1.2|Freedom—sort of.

Rosie|1.5|Go, go!
Jasper|1.6|I’m going! I’m going!
Bella|1.6|Bruno, keep up!
Bruno|1.4|Narrators are not built for cardio!

Bruno|1.2|Behind us, the leader climbed with inhuman calm.
Bruno|1.2|Like gravity had signed a contract.
Bruno|1.2|They stepped onto the crane platform just as we hit the catwalk.

Leader|1.6|Hand over AURORA.
Leader|1.6|And I might let you limp away.

Leo|1.7|We don’t even have it!
Rosie|1.5|He’s right. It’s still in the container.
Leader|1.4|Then why are you here?
Bella|1.5|Because you’re hiding something that hurts people.
Leader|1.6|People hurt people. We just monetize it.

Kiki|2.0|I hate you!
Kiki|2.0|Like, professionally!

Bruno|1.2|Kiki yanked a maintenance lever on the crane control box.
Bruno|1.2|A warning siren blared.
Bruno|1.2|The crane arm shifted with a groan.
Bruno|1.2|The catwalk trembled.

Rosie|1.8|Kiki!
Kiki|1.9|It’s fine! It’s—mostly fine!
Jasper|1.7|Nothing is fine when it’s attached to a crane!

Bruno|1.2|The leader stepped forward.
Bruno|1.2|Bella stepped forward too.
Bruno|1.2|For a second, time did that thing where it slows down and forces you to watch decisions happen.

Bella|1.2|Back off.
Leader|1.6|Or what?
Bella|1.6|Or you learn why I’m in charge.

Bruno|1.2|Bella grabbed a hanging chain and swung it like a pendulum.
Bruno|1.2|It slammed into the leader’s shoulder.
Bruno|1.2|They staggered—more surprised than hurt.

Leader|1.8|Enough!

Bruno|1.2|Rosie launched forward, fast and precise, sweeping a leg and knocking one of the hooded figures off balance.
Bruno|1.2|Leo shoved another back with a dramatic shout that sounded like an action hero audition.
Bruno|1.2|Jasper—bless him—threw a wrench and hit exactly nothing.
Bruno|1.2|Kiki cheered anyway.

Jasper|2.0|I tried!
Kiki|1.8|It was adorable!
Luna|1.7|Less adorable, more surviving!

Bruno|1.2|The crane lurched again.
Bruno|1.2|The catwalk tilted.
Bruno|1.2|Everyone slid toward the edge like marbles on a table.

Rosie|2.0|Grab something!
Leo|1.9|I’m grabbing!
Luna|1.8|I hate physics!
Jasper|1.9|My hands are wet!
Bella|1.8|Hold on!

Bruno|1.2|I grabbed the railing and felt my shoulders complain in three different languages.
Bruno|1.2|Below, the drop looked like the world’s meanest suggestion.

Bruno|1.2|The leader—still upright—stared at us through the rain.
Bruno|1.2|And then… laughed.

Leader|1.2|You don’t even know what AURORA is.
Leader|1.3|You just know it scares you.

Bella|1.4|We know enough.
Leader|1.4|No. You don’t.

Bruno|1.2|A distant horn blared—ships, or security, or both.
Bruno|1.2|The leader’s head turned slightly, calculating.
Bruno|1.2|Then they stepped back.

Leader|1.5|This isn’t over.
Leader|1.4|It’s just… postponed.

Bruno|1.2|They signaled.
Bruno|1.2|The hooded figures retreated into the maze, vanishing like smoke.
Bruno|1.2|And just like that, the fight drained out of the air, leaving only rain and our heavy breathing.

Luna|1.2|Are they gone?
Kiki|1.7|They’re gone. Cowards. Fashionable cowards, but still.
Rosie|1.3|Everyone check injuries.
Leo|1.5|I’m fine. My ego is bruised, but that’s normal.
Jasper|1.2|I’m alive. I think.
Bella|1.4|Bruno, narrate less and move more. We need off this crane.

Bruno|1.2|We crawled along the tilted catwalk, inch by inch.
Bruno|1.2|Somewhere, an alarm kept screaming.
Bruno|1.2|Somewhere else, people were coming to investigate.
Bruno|1.2|And in a black container labeled M-13, a crate called AURORA waited like a sleeping dragon.

Rosie|1.4|We can’t leave it there.
Bella|1.5|We’re not leaving it.
Jasper|1.3|Then we need a plan that doesn’t involve dying.
Kiki|1.8|Okay. New plan: we steal a forklift.
Luna|1.6|Kiki!
Leo|1.7|I love her brain.
Bruno|1.2|I hate that it might work.

Bruno|1.2|We dropped down behind the warehouse roofline and ran again—
Bruno|1.2|toward the lights, the engines, the chaos.
Bruno|1.2|Toward the next bad decision.
Bruno|1.2|Because that’s what heroes do.
Bruno|1.2|Or idiots.
Bruno|1.2|Sometimes the difference is just who tells the story.
