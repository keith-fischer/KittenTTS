Leo|1.2|People think a quiet town is a safe town.
Leo|1.2|They hear crickets, see porch lights, and assume the universe is being polite.
Leo|1.2|But quiet is just what the dark calls itself when it’s hungry.
Leo|1.2|And tonight, the dark was wearing perfume—sweet, floral, wrong.

Bella|1.4|Okay. Everyone stay together. No wandering. No “I’ll be right back.”
Jasper|1.3|I’m not wandering. I’m… strategically glued to the group.
Kiki|1.6|The air tastes like pennies. I hate it. I love it. I hate it again.
Luna|1.2|That’s the smell before a storm—or before something worse.
Rosie|1.4|Phones have no signal. That’s not coincidence. That’s an intention.

Leo|1.2|We weren’t supposed to be here.
Leo|1.2|We took the wrong turn off the highway, chasing a shortcut that looked harmless on a map.
Leo|1.2|Now we stood at the edge of Briar Hollow, a town that didn’t show up on GPS.
Leo|1.2|A wooden sign leaned toward us like it was tired: WELCOME HOME.

Kiki|1.7|“Welcome home” is not comforting when it’s not your home.
Bella|1.4|Agreed. We find a gas station, ask directions, and leave.
Jasper|1.3|Yes. Leaving is my favorite hobby.
Rosie|1.3|Look at the houses. Curtains are closed, but you can feel eyes behind them.

Leo|1.2|We walked down the main street.
Leo|1.2|Not a single car moved.
Leo|1.2|Not a single dog barked.
Leo|1.2|Even the streetlights were dim, like they were embarrassed to be seen.

Luna|1.2|Do you hear that?
Jasper|1.2|Hear what?
Luna|1.1|Exactly.

Leo|1.2|Silence isn’t empty.
Leo|1.2|It’s full of waiting.

Kiki|1.6|There’s a shop. Open sign is on.
Rosie|1.4|Of course it is. That’s how traps flirt.
Bella|1.3|We go in anyway. Quick in, quick out. Eyes open.

Leo|1.2|The bell over the door didn’t ring when we entered.
Leo|1.2|It just… sighed.
Leo|1.2|Inside, the air was warmer, thick with dried herbs and dust.
Leo|1.2|Jars lined the walls. Labels written in a looping hand: SLEEP. LUCK. SORROW. REMEMBER.

Jasper|1.2|I don’t like the jar that says “REMEMBER.”
Kiki|1.7|I do. It’s honest.
Rosie|1.3|There’s no cashier.
Bella|1.4|Hello? Anyone here?

Leo|1.2|From the back room, something scraped—slow, deliberate.
Leo|1.2|Then the curtain parted and a woman stepped out, smiling like she’d practiced in a mirror that hated her.

Luna|1.1|Nope.
Kiki|1.6|That smile is… too many teeth.
Rosie|1.4|Stay polite. Polite keeps you alive.
Bella|1.4|Hi. We’re a little lost. We need directions back to the highway.

Leo|1.2|The woman didn’t answer.
Leo|1.2|She just tilted her head, listening to us like we were music.
Leo|1.2|Then she raised one finger to her lips.

Jasper|1.0|She’s doing the “shh” thing.
Kiki|1.5|I want to bite that finger off.
Rosie|1.3|Kiki. No.

Leo|1.2|Another figure stepped out behind her.
Leo|1.2|Then another.
Leo|1.2|Three women total, dressed like the town itself had stitched them together—dark fabric, thorn-like jewelry, hair pinned with little bones.
Leo|1.2|Witches, if you like simple words.
Leo|1.2|But simple words didn’t fit what they were.

Bella|1.3|We’ll just go.
Rosie|1.3|Don’t turn your back.
Luna|1.2|My heart is trying to evacuate my body.
Kiki|1.6|My heart is trying to start a fight.

Leo|1.2|The tallest witch smiled wider.
Leo|1.2|Her eyes were black—too black—like there was no white left to remember being human.

Leo|1.2|And then she spoke.
Leo|1.2|Not in a voice.
Leo|1.2|In a feeling.

Jasper|1.0|Did… did she just talk inside my skull?
Luna|1.1|Yes.
Rosie|1.2|Don’t respond. Don’t give it a path.
Kiki|1.7|I’m responding with violence, mentally.

Leo|1.2|The jars started to rattle.
Leo|1.2|At first like a tremor.
Leo|1.2|Then like applause.

Bella|1.4|Everyone out. Now.
Rosie|1.5|Move.

Leo|1.2|The door wouldn’t open.
Leo|1.2|Bella yanked. Rosie shoved. Jasper’s hands shook against the handle.
Leo|1.2|The door stayed shut, calm as a coffin lid.

Jasper|1.8|It’s locked!
Luna|1.6|It wasn’t locked when we came in!
Kiki|1.8|Because now it’s hungry!
Bella|1.7|Rosie—window!

Rosie|1.6|On it.

Leo|1.2|Rosie grabbed a brass candleholder and smashed the window.
Leo|1.2|Glass fell like frozen rain.
Leo|1.2|Cold air rushed in—and with it, the smell of wet soil and something older.

Leo|1.2|We climbed out.
Leo|1.2|The moment my feet hit the street, I heard the bell above the shop door ring behind us.
Leo|1.2|A cheerful little chime.
Leo|1.2|Like it was saying, “Goodbye.”
Leo|1.2|Like it knew we’d be back.

Kiki|1.8|Run. Please. I’m begging, and I never beg.
Bella|1.7|Go!

Leo|1.2|We sprinted down the street.
Leo|1.2|The town stayed still.
Leo|1.2|But the shadows moved wrong—sliding uphill, bending around corners before we reached them.
Leo|1.2|Streetlights flickered in sequence, like something was chasing us by turning the world off and on.

Luna|1.7|They’re herding us!
Jasper|1.8|To where?!
Rosie|1.6|Don’t stop! Don’t split!
Kiki|1.9|I swear I saw someone in that window—someone waving like they’re trapped!
Bella|1.7|No detours! Not yet!

Leo|1.2|We hit the town square.
Leo|1.2|An old fountain sat dry and cracked, filled with leaves.
Leo|1.2|At its center: a stone statue of three women holding hands.
Leo|1.2|Their faces were worn, but the posture was unmistakable.
Leo|1.2|A warning turned into a monument.

Rosie|1.3|This place worships them.
Luna|1.4|Or fears them so much it became the same thing.
Jasper|1.2|I can’t tell which is worse.
Kiki|1.6|Both. It’s both.

Leo|1.2|The wind picked up.
Leo|1.2|Not random.
Leo|1.2|Directed.
Leo|1.2|It pushed us toward the fountain like hands on our backs.

Bella|1.6|Back up! Don’t let it push you!
Jasper|1.7|It’s pushing me!
Luna|1.6|It’s like the air has opinions!
Rosie|1.6|Grip each other—link arms!

Kiki|1.8|I’ve got Luna. I’ve got you. I’ve got—
Kiki|1.9|—whatever this nightmare is, I’ve got it!

Leo|1.2|We locked arms.
Leo|1.2|The wind fought harder.
Leo|1.2|The streetlights went out all at once.
Leo|1.2|And in the sudden dark, the fountain water—dry a second ago—began to fill.
Leo|1.2|Not with water.
Leo|1.2|With ink.

Luna|1.0|No.
Jasper|1.0|That’s not—
Rosie|1.1|Don’t look into it.
Bella|1.2|Everyone keep your eyes up. Don’t give it your attention.

Leo|1.2|Something in the ink moved.
Leo|1.2|A pale shape, like a hand under a blanket.
Leo|1.2|Then fingers pressed up, trying to break the surface.

Kiki|1.9|I’m looking. I don’t care. I’m looking.
Rosie|1.6|Kiki, stop—
Kiki|2.0|I SAID I’M LOOKING!

Leo|1.2|The thing in the fountain turned toward Kiki.
Leo|1.2|Not with a face.
Leo|1.2|With recognition.

Kiki|1.2|It knows me.
Luna|1.1|Kiki…
Kiki|1.1|It knows me. It’s… calling me my real name.
Bella|1.6|Don’t answer it.
Rosie|1.5|Kiki, breathe. Keep breathing.

Leo|1.2|A whisper slid through the square.
Leo|1.2|Not from one direction—from everywhere.
Leo|1.2|The witches stepped out from the dark between buildings as if the darkness had been holding them for later.
Leo|1.2|Their silhouettes were wrong at the edges, like smoke trying to pretend it was solid.

Bella|1.5|We leave the square. Now.
Jasper|1.6|Where?! Everything looks the same!
Luna|1.6|The streets are looping. We passed that statue already.
Rosie|1.4|They’re bending the town. We need an anchor—something real.
Kiki|1.7|The car. The car is real. We run to the car.

Leo|1.2|We ran.
Leo|1.2|The town shifted.
Leo|1.2|Buildings stretched taller, then shorter.
Leo|1.2|The road ahead curled like a ribbon being pulled by invisible hands.
Leo|1.2|And through it all, the witches followed without hurrying.
Leo|1.2|Because they didn’t need to hurry.
Leo|1.2|The town was doing the chasing.

Jasper|1.9|I see the car!
Bella|1.8|Go! Go!
Rosie|1.7|Keys! Who has keys?!
Luna|1.8|Jasper—keys!
Jasper|2.0|I HAVE THEM!

Leo|1.2|Jasper fumbled with the key fob, hands shaking so hard it looked like the keys were trying to escape him.
Leo|1.2|The car lights flashed.
Leo|1.2|Blessed, normal light.

Kiki|1.8|Get in! Get in!
Bella|1.7|Move!
Rosie|1.6|Head down—don’t look at them!
Luna|1.6|I’m not looking! I’m not looking!

Leo|1.2|We piled in.
Leo|1.2|Jasper turned the key.
Leo|1.2|The engine coughed.
Leo|1.2|Then died.
Leo|1.2|It coughed again, weaker, like it was scared.

Jasper|2.0|No no no—come on!
Bella|1.8|Try again!
Rosie|1.7|Don’t panic!
Kiki|1.9|PANIC LATER, START NOW!

Leo|1.2|Outside the windshield, the witches stood in a line.
Leo|1.2|They raised their hands together—like a choir beginning a hymn.

Luna|1.1|They’re doing something.
Rosie|1.2|Don’t watch. Listen to me. Listen to my voice.
Bella|1.4|Everyone focus on Rosie. Ignore the window.
Kiki|1.6|I hate ignoring things.
Rosie|1.4|Do it anyway.

Leo|1.2|The temperature dropped.
Leo|1.2|Frost laced the inside of the glass in delicate patterns—beautiful like a threat.
Leo|1.2|The radio clicked on by itself.
Leo|1.2|Static, then a lullaby—warped, slow, played backward.

Jasper|1.0|I can’t—my hands—
Bella|1.6|Jasper, look at me. Breathe. You can do this.
Jasper|1.1|I’m trying.
Bella|1.4|Try harder. For me.

Leo|1.2|Jasper’s breathing steadied.
Leo|1.2|He turned the key again.
Leo|1.2|The engine caught—this time roaring like it was offended.

Kiki|1.9|YES!
Luna|1.7|Go go go!
Rosie|1.6|Drive!

Leo|1.2|Jasper hit the gas.
Leo|1.2|The tires spun on wet pavement.
Leo|1.2|For a second, we didn’t move—as if the town itself had hands on the bumper.
Leo|1.2|Then Bella leaned forward, voice sharp as a blade.

Bella|1.8|MOVE.

Leo|1.2|The car lurched free.
Leo|1.2|We tore down the street.
Leo|1.2|Behind us, the witches didn’t chase.
Leo|1.2|They just watched.
Leo|1.2|And the worst part?
Leo|1.2|They smiled like they’d already won.

Kiki|1.6|Why aren’t they chasing?!
Rosie|1.3|Because they don’t need to.
Luna|1.2|Because they marked us.
Jasper|1.3|Marked us… how?
Bella|1.4|Look at your wrist.

Leo|1.2|I looked.
Leo|1.2|On my skin, a faint symbol had appeared—an arrow splitting a circle.
Leo|1.2|Not ink.
Leo|1.2|Not a bruise.
Leo|1.2|A brand, cold to the touch.

Leo|1.2|I checked the others.
Leo|1.2|Bella had it.
Leo|1.2|Rosie had it.
Leo|1.2|Luna had it.
Leo|1.2|Kiki had it.
Leo|1.2|Jasper had it too.
Leo|1.2|Like the town had stamped us as “RETURN TO SENDER.”

Luna|1.1|It’s on all of us.
Rosie|1.2|That means it’s a tether.
Kiki|1.4|It means they can find us.
Jasper|1.2|It means we’re not done.
Bella|1.5|It means we fight back.

Leo|1.2|The highway finally appeared—bright, loud, normal.
Leo|1.2|We crossed the invisible line out of Briar Hollow.
Leo|1.2|The air warmed.
Leo|1.2|Signals returned.
Leo|1.2|The world pretended nothing happened.

Leo|1.2|But my wrist burned under my sleeve.
Leo|1.2|And in the rearview mirror—
Leo|1.2|for just a blink—
Leo|1.2|I saw the town sign again.
Leo|1.2|WELCOME HOME.

Kiki|1.6|We’re not going back.
Rosie|1.3|We might not get to choose.
Luna|1.2|We’ll choose anyway.
Jasper|1.2|How do you fight witches?
Bella|1.5|The same way you fight anything that feeds on fear.
Bella|1.4|You stop being afraid.

Leo|1.2|None of us answered.
Leo|1.2|Because fear is easy to insult in daylight.
Leo|1.2|Harder at night.
Leo|1.2|Harder when you know something has your name memorized.

Leo|1.2|And somewhere behind us, in a town that shouldn’t exist—
Leo|1.2|three witches waited patiently,
Leo|1.2|like spiders in a web,
Leo|1.2|feeling the tug of their new thread.
